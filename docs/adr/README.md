# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the HomeAccount project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## üìù ADR Format

We follow the standard ADR format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: Title

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?
```

## üéØ When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions about:

- **Architecture Changes**: Major structural modifications to the system
- **Technology Choices**: Selecting frameworks, libraries, or tools
- **Design Patterns**: Establishing coding standards or architectural patterns
- **Integration Approaches**: How systems communicate or integrate
- **Data Models**: Database design or data flow decisions
- **Security Policies**: Authentication, authorization, or data protection
- **Performance Strategies**: Caching, optimization, or scaling approaches

## üìä Decision Categories

### High Impact
Decisions that significantly affect:
- System architecture
- Technology stack
- Development workflow
- Data integrity

### Medium Impact  
Decisions that moderately affect:
- Code organization
- Development tools
- Testing strategies
- Documentation structure

### Low Impact
Decisions that minimally affect:
- Naming conventions
- Minor tool choices
- Formatting standards

## üîÑ ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: ADR is drafted and under discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision is approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer recommended
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

When creating a new ADR:

1. **Use the next sequential number** (003, 004, etc.)
2. **Follow the standard format** shown above
3. **Be specific and concise** in your context and decision
4. **Consider consequences** both positive and negative
5. **Update this index** with your new ADR
6. **Link related documents** in the "Related Documentation" section

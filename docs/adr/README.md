# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the HomeAccount project. ADRs document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Status

- **Proposed**: The decision is proposed and under discussion
- **Accepted**: The decision is agreed upon and implemented
- **Deprecated**: The decision is no longer relevant but kept for historical reference
- **Superseded**: The decision has been replaced by a newer decision

## Current ADRs

| Number | Title | Status | Date |
|--------|-------|--------|------|
| [000](./000-shared-folder-for-types-and-utilities.md) | Shared Folder for DTOs and Utilities | ACCEPTED | 2024-01-15 |

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, follow this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status
[PROPOSED | ACCEPTED | DEPRECATED | SUPERSEDED]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?]
```

## Guidelines

1. **Number ADRs sequentially** starting from 000
2. **Use kebab-case for filenames**: `001-database-choice.md`
3. **Keep decisions focused** on single architectural concerns
4. **Include examples** when helpful for understanding
5. **Document alternatives considered** to show reasoning
6. **Set review dates** for time-sensitive decisions
7. **Link related ADRs** to show decision dependencies

## Future ADR Topics

Potential upcoming architectural decisions:

- Database choice and ORM selection
- Authentication and authorization strategy  
- API versioning approach
- Frontend state management
- Testing strategy and tools
- Deployment and CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and observability
- Error handling and logging
